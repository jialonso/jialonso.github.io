<h3 class="title">About me</h3>

<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>I received the MSc. and PhD degrees in Computer Science in 2009 and 2016, respectively, from the <a href="http://www.uclm.es/" target="_blank">University of Castilla-La Mancha</a>, Spain. I am currently member of the <a href="http://simd.albacete.org/" target="_blank">Intelligent Systems and Datamining</a> research group in the <a href="http://www.i3a.uclm.es/" target="_blank">Albacete Research Institute of Informatics I3A</a>.</p>
	<p>I am interested in learning from data within machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics. I am particularly interested in learning and reasoning with probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks. </p>
	<p>I work at <a href="http://www.grupovermon.com/" target="_blank">Grupo Vermon</a> and I am currently involved in various projects related to IoT and Big Data.</p>
